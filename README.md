We are moving beyond simple API calls and designing full-fledged "Cognitive Architectures." This requires careful integration of memory, reasoning, and interaction layers.

●
The Brain (LLMs): We must prioritize speed and context window capacity. We will utilize Gemini 1.5 Flash (via Google AI Studio) for its excellent multimodal and reasoning capabilities, or Groq (using Llama 3) for industry-leading inference speed. Both provide high-speed, high-limit free tiers, which are ideal for production simulation and scaling proofs-of-concept.
●
The Memory (Vector Database): Crucially, we are avoiding the added complexity and latency of a separate vector database. We will leverage MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. This architecture allows us to keep our core application data (User profiles, chat history) and the AI's long-term memory (semantic Embeddings) in the same document database, drastically reducing latency for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
●
The Orchestrator (Backend Logic): LangChain.js or LlamaIndex.TS will be the central nervous system. These libraries manage the intricate "Chain of Thought" logic, seamlessly handling the flow: User Prompt $\rightarrow$ Retrieve Context from MongoDB $\rightarrow$ Send Context + Prompt to LLM $\rightarrow$ Format and Stream Response.
●
The Interface (UX): User expectation for AI is instantaneous response. Since LLM responses take time, the React.js interface must implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream the response text token-by-token. This "Typing effect" is mandatory for maintaining user engagement and perceived speed.
●
Infrastructure Essentials:
○
Puppeteer: Required for headless browser rendering, specifically for generating pixel-perfect PDFs in the Resume project.
○
Stripe: The backbone for all SaaS projects, managing complex subscription tiers, payments, and webhooks.
○
Docker: Mandatory containerization for all projects to ensure environment consistency across development, staging, and production.
